# Agent Working Guidelines

## Target-State Code Quality Standard

This section defines the required target architecture for the repository. It is not a description of the current code and existing legacy code is not a precedent for new work.

All new code must follow this standard. When changing legacy code, migrate the touched capability toward this target instead of extending the legacy pattern. Keep migrations behavior-preserving and bounded to the requested capability. If compliance would require a risky expansion of scope, stop and explain the conflict rather than adding more architectural debt.

The detailed rationale and staged migration plan live in `docs/business-code-layering-and-refactoring.md`. This file is the authoritative implementation policy when an agent writes or reviews code. Cursor project rules under `.cursor/rules/` distill the same policy into always-on and file-scoped agent constraints; prefer those rules for session context, and use this document plus the layering doc when fuller rationale or the staged migration plan is required.

### Architecture Model

Organize code by business capability first and by technical layer inside each capability.

The required dependency direction is:

```text
delivery/presentation -> application -> domain
infrastructure -> application ports and domain types
composition root -> all layers for dependency wiring only
```

The following dependencies are forbidden:

```text
domain -> framework, ORM, HTTP, filesystem, queue, environment, or third-party SDK
application -> FastAPI Request/Response, React, Next.js, SQLAlchemy implementation, or browser globals
infrastructure -> route, page, component, or presentation code
module/feature -> another module/feature's private files
database migration -> runtime application service
new module -> private helpers in a compatibility or legacy module
```

Cross-capability collaboration must use a named public API, an application port, or a stable contract. Never bypass a boundary with deep imports, circular imports, runtime import tricks, or a generic shared helper.

### Target Repository Layout

Create directories only when they contain real code. Do not create empty architecture scaffolding.

```

Do not add top-level dumping grounds such as `utils`, `helpers`, `managers`, or a universal `services` directory. Shared code must already have at least two real consumers and a stable, business-neutral meaning.

### Python Implementation Standard

#### Domain and application code

- Domain code contains entities, value objects, invariants, policies, and state transitions. It must be deterministic and testable without FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, the filesystem, or network access.
- Application code implements named user intentions such as `ImportBook`, `MergeWorks`, or `SaveReaderProgress`. It owns orchestration, authorization policy calls, transaction boundaries, and side-effect ordering.
- Use immutable dataclasses or validated value objects for domain inputs and results. Use Pydantic models at external boundaries.
- Do not pass `Request`, `Response`, ORM models, database rows, or `dict[str, Any]` into domain code.
- Stable boundaries must not use `Any`. At genuinely dynamic external boundaries, accept `object`/unknown input, validate it, and map it immediately to an explicit type.
- Prefer pure functions for pure behavior. Use a class only when it owns injected dependencies, a lifecycle, or meaningful state.
- Avoid boolean mode flags that make one function perform unrelated workflows. Use separate named commands or strategies.
- Do not use mutable module-level business state. Process coordination belongs in an explicit runtime object or persistent store.

#### ORM-only persistence

All application database access must use SQLAlchemy ORM and typed SQLAlchemy expression APIs. Handwritten SQL is prohibited.

Forbidden everywhere in application and migration code:

- SQL strings, including dynamically composed or interpolated SQL;
- `sqlalchemy.text()`;
- `Session.execute()` or `Connection.execute()` with textual SQL;
- `exec_driver_sql()`;
- direct `sqlite3` access;
- raw cursor operations;
- string-based WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, column, or table fragments;
- copying existing raw-SQL helpers into new modules;
- using raw SQL as a shortcut for a missing ORM relationship or query model.

Required persistence approach:

- Define tables and relationships with SQLAlchemy 2.x declarative mapped models using `Mapped[...]` and `mapped_column()`.
- Express reads with `select()`, relationships, loader options, `Session.scalars()`, and typed projections.
- Express writes through mapped entities or SQLAlchemy `insert()`, `update()`, and `delete()` expression objects when set-based operations are genuinely required.
- Encapsulate persistence behind capability-specific repositories or query objects. Name them after an aggregate or use case, not a database table collection.
- Return domain objects or explicit DTOs. ORM entities must not escape into HTTP schemas, React contracts, or unrelated capabilities.
- Prevent N+1 behavior intentionally with explicit loading strategies. Do not solve it by returning unbounded object graphs.
- Pagination must have a deterministic order and a documented maximum page size.
- Low-level repositories may `flush()` but must not hide `commit()` or `rollback()`. The application use case owns the transaction.
- Use `with session.begin():` or an equivalent explicit unit-of-work boundary for writes.
- Do not catch integrity errors and treat them as normal control flow unless they are translated into a named domain/application conflict with the original exception preserved.

Legacy raw SQL is migration debt, not an accepted style. When touching a raw-SQL behavior, add characterization coverage and migrate the affected query to ORM within the same bounded capability. If that is unsafe within scope, do not add or modify raw SQL without explicit user direction.

#### Schema migrations

- Migrations must use SQLAlchemy schema objects and migration operations, not handwritten SQL strings.
- Model every schema object explicitly: tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys, unique constraints, and defaults.
- For SQLite table rebuilds, use a migration framework's batch/table-copy operations or SQLAlchemy schema APIs; do not write manual `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `INSERT ... SELECT`, or PRAGMA strings.
- Each migration is ordered, deterministic, restart-aware, and immutable after release.
- Separate schema change from expensive data backfill. Backfills use typed ORM models or SQLAlchemy expression objects and support bounded batches and restart.
- Test fresh database creation, every supported upgrade path, repeat invocation, partial completion, and failure recovery.
- Runtime services must never be imported by a migration. Migration-local data transformations must be stable and self-contained.

#### FastAPI delivery

Route handlers are thin adapters. They may:

1. parse and validate transport input;
2. acquire the authenticated actor and injected dependencies;
3. invoke one application command or query;
4. map the result or a named error to the established HTTP contract.

Route handlers must not contain ORM queries, business decisions, filesystem operations, media parsing, queue coordination, or multi-service workflow logic.

- Use explicit Pydantic request and response models for every JSON endpoint.
- Do not return arbitrary dictionaries for stable endpoints.
- Keep path, method, status, error code, response envelope, and authorization behavior backward-compatible unless the user explicitly requests a contract change.
- Program logic branches on stable error codes/types, never on localized message strings.
- Validate resource-level authorization inside the use case even when middleware also protects a route prefix.

#### Workers and integrations

- API routes, workers, schedulers, and CLIs call the same application use cases. They must not call each other's presentation code.
- Worker boundaries own polling, leases, retry/backoff, shutdown, task acknowledgement, and final containment logging.
- Broad `except Exception` is allowed only at a process/task containment boundary that records context and makes an explicit retry, quarantine, or terminal decision.
- External systems, converters, filesystem access, clocks, random IDs, and third-party SDKs are adapters behind application ports.
- Filesystem publication uses a temporary path, validation, and atomic replace where supported. Cross-database/filesystem workflows require an explicit recoverable intermediate state and idempotency key.

#### Python style and maintainability

- Target Python 3.11 and use modern type syntax.
- All public functions, methods, and class attributes are fully typed.
- Use domain-specific names. Avoid abbreviations, vague names such as `data`, `item`, `manager`, and misleading technical names for business concepts.
- A function has one level of abstraction and one reason to change. Extract a named policy or use case when branching represents business variants.
- Prefer early validation and guard clauses over deeply nested control flow.
- Never use mutable default arguments, wildcard imports, hidden monkey patches, or import-time I/O.
- Do not suppress type or lint errors globally. A local suppression requires a comment explaining why the tool cannot model safe code.

### TypeScript and React Implementation Standard

#### Types and contracts

- TypeScript remains in strict mode. Do not weaken compiler options.
- `any`, broad type assertions, non-null assertions, `@ts-ignore`, and unchecked JSON casts are prohibited in business code.
- Treat all network, storage, URL, postMessage, and browser persistence input as `unknown`; validate it at the boundary before mapping it into domain types.
- Generate stable API wire types from OpenAPI where available. Generated files are read-only.
- Keep API DTOs, domain models, view models, and editable form state distinct. Do not reuse one oversized type across all layers.
- Use discriminated unions for state machines and operation results. Model impossible states out instead of coordinating unrelated booleans.

#### API access

- Direct `fetch()` is allowed only inside `shared/api` transport and feature `api/client.ts` adapters.
- Components, pages, providers, reducers, and model code must never call `fetch()` directly.
- The shared transport owns base-path handling, credentials, request cancellation, content type, envelope decoding, session-expiry signaling, and normalized transport errors.
- Feature API adapters own endpoint-specific runtime validation and mapping from wire DTOs to feature models.
- UI code handles named application outcomes, not raw status numbers or localized backend messages.
- Every async effect supports cancellation or stale-result rejection where the initiating view can change or unmount.

#### Features, state, and React

- `app` route files are composition points, not business modules.
- Feature `model` code is framework-independent and contains pure rules, reducers, selectors, and types.
- Feature `application` code coordinates API calls, mutations, server state, optimistic behavior, and use-case hooks.
- Feature `ui` renders models and emits user intentions. It does not parse envelopes or implement persistence rules.
- A feature's internal files may only be imported through its `public.ts` from outside that feature.
- Shared UI is business-neutral, accessible, and does not import features.
- Keep one owner for each state: URL for shareable navigation state, server cache/application layer for server facts, local component for transient visual state, and an explicit store/runtime for cross-page sessions.
- Do not mirror props or server state into local state through effects unless an external synchronization contract requires it.
- `useEffect` is for synchronizing external systems, not for computing derived state or chaining internal business transitions.
- All hook dependencies are correct. Never silence `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` to force desired timing.
- Prefer reducers or explicit state machines for workflows with multiple phases, cancellation, retries, or concurrent events.
- Components must preserve keyboard, pointer, touch, focus, reduced-motion, and screen-reader behavior where applicable.

#### TypeScript style and maintainability

- Use named exports for feature/public modules unless a framework requires a default export.
- Prefer small cohesive modules, but do not create pass-through files or prop-forwarding components solely to reduce line count.
- Business rules must be named pure functions, not dense inline JSX expressions.
- Avoid boolean prop proliferation. Prefer variants, composition, or explicit state objects.
- Do not access `window`, `document`, storage, or browser APIs from pure model code.
- Timers, subscriptions, observers, object URLs, and event listeners must have explicit cleanup and ownership.
- Memoization is a measured optimization, not a default. Correct state ownership comes before `useMemo`/`useCallback`.

### Cross-Cutting Quality Rules

#### Transactions and side effects

Every write use case must document and test:

1. validation and authorization;
2. current-state read;
3. domain decision;
4. database/file temporary writes;
5. transaction commit;
6. event, queue, or file publication;
7. compensation, retry, or recoverable failure state.

Hidden commits, fire-and-forget promises, and untracked background tasks are prohibited.

#### Error handling

- Define a small, capability-specific error taxonomy.
- Preserve the original exception as the cause when translating infrastructure failures.
- Never expose secrets, credentials, internal paths, SQL details, or stack traces in user-facing errors.
- Do not catch an exception unless the code can add context, translate it, compensate, retry, or contain a process boundary.
- Empty catch blocks and fallback-to-success behavior are prohibited.

#### Security and authorization

- Validate and normalize all external input at the boundary.
- Scope database queries by the authenticated actor; do not load all rows and filter them in memory.
- Preserve anti-enumeration behavior where not-found and forbidden responses are intentionally indistinguishable.
- Never trust client-provided ownership, role, path, MIME type, filename, or content length.
- Filesystem paths must be resolved against configured roots and checked for traversal and symlink escape.
- Secrets never appear in source, logs, fixtures, snapshots, generated artifacts, or error responses.

#### Internationalization

- User-visible text is never used as a programmatic identifier.
- Application error codes and event types are locale-neutral.
- Dates, times, numbers, percentages, and relative time use the active locale.
- User-provided titles, authors, tags, series names, paths, and filenames remain unchanged.
- Every user-visible feature is complete for `zh-CN` and `en-US`, including non-DOM surfaces.

#### Observability

- Emit structured logs/events at process and use-case boundaries with stable event names.
- Include correlation identifiers, actor/tenant scope where safe, target identifiers, stage, and outcome.
- Do not log entire request bodies, book contents, tokens, cookies, passwords, or provider credentials.
- Metrics and logs must distinguish validation failures, authorization failures, conflicts, infrastructure failures, retries, and terminal failures.

### Testing Standard

Tests follow the same capability layout as production code.

- Domain unit tests cover invariants, boundaries, and state transitions without framework or database setup.
- Application tests use fakes for ports and verify orchestration, authorization, transaction outcome, and side-effect ordering.
- Repository integration tests use real SQLite and SQLAlchemy ORM, including constraints, relationships, pagination, eager loading, and rollback behavior.
- API contract tests verify method, path, status, envelope, field names, error codes, and authorization roles.
- Migration tests cover fresh creation and every supported upgrade path.
- Worker tests cover idempotency, retry, lease expiry, shutdown, abandoned work, and recovery.
- Web model tests cover pure rules and reducers; component tests cover interaction and accessibility; E2E covers only critical cross-layer journeys.
- Every defect fix starts with a failing regression test and audits adjacent behavior variants under the functional triage rule below.
- Tests assert observable behavior, not private implementation details. Mock only owned ports, not every internal function.
- Time, randomness, filesystem roots, and external services must be controllable in tests.

No change is complete with newly skipped, flaky, or silently weakened tests.

### Quality Gates

The target CI pipeline must enforce:

```bash
# Python
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
mypy app
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing

# Web
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm i18n:check
```

Also run capability-appropriate migration, runtime smoke, Playwright, PWA, and worker checks.

Quality requirements:

- Do not lower strictness, coverage thresholds, or rule sets to make a change pass.
- Do not add blanket exclusions, broad `noqa`, `type: ignore`, ESLint disable blocks, or test skips.
- Coverage is a risk signal, not a substitute for boundary and failure-path tests.
- A large module is a review trigger, not automatically a defect. Refactor when responsibilities, dependency direction, state ownership, or testability are unclear.
- New warnings are failures. Pre-existing warnings in touched code must be resolved unless doing so would materially expand scope.

### Refactoring Standard

Refactor one named capability at a time:

1. inventory entry points, callers, roles, contracts, state changes, and side effects;
2. add characterization tests for current public behavior;
3. extract pure rules and explicit types;
4. replace raw SQL in the touched capability with ORM models and typed queries;
5. introduce capability-specific ports and adapters;
6. move orchestration and transaction ownership into an application use case;
7. make routes, workers, and UI thin adapters;
8. remove the legacy implementation after callers switch;
9. run focused and broad gates;
10. record an ADR for durable cross-capability decisions.

Do not combine architecture migration, product redesign, dependency upgrades, broad formatting, and unrelated cleanup in one change.

Temporary compatibility code must have a named owner, protective tests, and an explicit removal condition. “Clean up later” is not an acceptable exit plan.

### Definition of Done

A change is complete only when:

- the business capability and invariants are explicit;
- code resides in the target capability and layer;
- dependency direction is valid and no private cross-feature import was added;
- all database access uses SQLAlchemy ORM or typed expression APIs with no handwritten SQL;
- transaction ownership and failure recovery are explicit;
- HTTP, worker, database, filesystem, authorization, and locale contracts remain compatible unless intentionally changed;
- stable boundaries use explicit validated types;
- both `zh-CN` and `en-US` are complete;
- focused tests and all applicable quality gates pass;
- no duplicate implementation, unexplained compatibility shim, warning, or unowned follow-up remains.

## Functional Bug Triage

When the user reports that a feature does not work, do not treat the named action as an isolated checklist item. Treat it as an example of a broader capability area and audit the adjacent behaviors that a user would naturally expect.

For every reported broken interaction:

1. Identify the underlying user intent and feature surface.
2. List the expected interaction variants for that surface.
3. Check which variants are already implemented, partially implemented, or missing.
4. Fix the reported issue and any closely related missing behaviors unless the scope would become risky or unrelated.
5. In the final response, name the broader capability area that was checked, not only the literal symptom.

Example: if the user says EPUB left/right page turning and swipe page turning do not work, expand the investigation to the full reader navigation surface:

- Keyboard shortcuts: left/right arrows, space/page keys where appropriate, and escape for dismissing overlays if the UI supports it.
- Pointer navigation: left/right page zones, center tap to show or hide controls, toolbar buttons, progress slider, and table-of-contents jumps.
- Touch navigation: horizontal swipe, tap zones, scroll behavior in scrolled mode, and PWA standalone behavior.
- Focus boundaries: whether events are captured by iframes, overlays, controls, or embedded reader content.
- State recovery: whether hidden controls can always be shown again after immersive mode.
- Reader parity: whether EPUB, comic, PDF, and text readers offer comparable navigation affordances where the format allows.

Use this same "reported symptom -> expected capability set -> implementation audit" pattern for other feature areas such as upload/import, search/filtering, library organization, settings, progress sync, offline/PWA behavior, and mobile layouts.

## Internationalization Completeness

The application has complete internationalization support for `zh-CN` and `en-US`. Treat English adaptation as part of the definition of done for every new feature and user-visible change.

For every implementation:

1. Audit all user-visible text, including headings, buttons, form labels, placeholders, validation messages, empty states, errors, toasts, confirmation dialogs, accessibility labels, page metadata, PWA content, emails, downloaded/generated documents, and backend-generated status messages.
2. Use the shared Web i18n APIs in `apps/web/i18n` instead of shipping untranslated UI literals. Add both the Chinese source message and a deliberate English translation to the locale catalogs.
3. Preserve interpolation placeholders exactly across locales. Dynamic values such as book titles, authors, tags, series names, shelf names, file paths, and other user-provided content must remain unchanged and must not be treated as translatable application copy.
4. Use the active locale for dates, times, numbers, percentages, and relative-time formatting. Do not introduce hard-coded `zh-CN` formatting in user-facing features.
5. Keep backend and non-DOM surfaces in scope. When a feature adds API errors, system events, email content, PWA metadata, service-worker responses, or generated files, provide an English-compatible message contract or localized output as appropriate.
6. Update or add tests for both locales when behavior, metadata, interpolation, or generated content changes.
7. Run `pnpm i18n:check` from `apps/web` before considering the work complete. Do not ship with missing catalog entries, Chinese text remaining in the English catalog, stale keys, or mismatched placeholders.

## EPUB.js Dependency Boundary

Treat EPUB.js as an immutable third-party dependency:

1. Use the latest official npm release without modifying its source files.
2. Never edit files under `node_modules/epubjs`, vendor modified EPUB.js source, or add a package patch that changes EPUB.js behavior.
3. Do not attribute a reader defect to EPUB.js unless a matching upstream GitHub issue, discussion, fix commit, or release note provides concrete evidence. Without that evidence, treat the defect as an application integration, configuration, lifecycle, or API-usage problem.
4. Fix EPUB reader behavior only through EPUB.js public APIs and this repository's own adapter, controller, presentation, and input code.

## Release Version Consistency

Treat a release as a coordinated application-version update, not only a GitHub tag or GitHub Release operation.

For every versioned release:

1. Choose one semantic version and use it consistently for the GitHub tag, release title, Docker/package artifacts, the Web application, and the backend application.
2. Before creating the release tag, update every application-owned version source, including at least:
   - the root `package.json` version, which is the canonical release version and is displayed by the Web “About” page;
   - `apps/web/package.json`;
   - `apps/api-python/pyproject.toml`;
   - the backend runtime default in `apps/api-python/app/core/config.py`;
   - generated lockfiles such as `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `apps/api-python/uv.lock` when their package-version metadata changes.
3. Verify that the system Web “About” page displays the new version and that backend version responses/runtime metadata report the same version.
4. Verify that the GitHub tag is exactly `v<version>` and matches the root `package.json` version before publishing. Do not publish when any application, page, runtime metadata, lockfile, tag, or artifact still reports the previous or a conflicting version.
5. Fill in the GitHub Release description before publishing. Write a few concise sentences that summarize the release's most important fixes, improvements, and user-visible feature changes; do not publish a release with an empty description or only an auto-generated change list.
6. Include version-consistency checks in the release validation or workflow whenever practical, so a mismatched Web, backend, package, artifact, or GitHub release version fails before publication.
