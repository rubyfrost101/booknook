# Design QA

## Target

- Parent reference: `codex-clipboard-adb36960-cd80-44c3-b676-f9208a56e30c.png` (`/library`).
- Detail reference: `codex-clipboard-8a103780-a054-46d1-a87a-b5ec99d3a3d6.png` (`/works/:id`).
- Restored action-menu reference: `codex-clipboard-d2c164a0-be35-4db3-bb64-2799c26d7fba.png`.
- Implementation capture: `book-detail-global-frame-and-actions.png`.

## Visual comparison

- The application shell now owns one centered 1280px content frame through the global `--booknook-content-max-width` token. Library and work-detail pages no longer declare competing page widths.
- At the same 2560px browser viewport, automated measurements for both `/library` and the opened work detail are identical: left `764.33`, right `2044.33`, width `1280`.
- A stable root scrollbar gutter prevents the centered frame from shifting when moving between a long list and a shorter detail state.
- The restored action menu matches the former visual hierarchy: 288px white surface, rounded coners, shadow, icon-led rows, and a separator before the destructive action.
- The earlier restored hero, reading controls, media tabs, volume wall, content-structure view, and single-volume chapter-detail view remain intact inside the shared frame.

## Interaction comparison

- The overflow menu exposes `编辑信息`, `元数据识别`, `上传自定义封面`, `重新生成封面`, `下载当前版本`, `发送到 Kindle`, and `删除记录`.
- `从书库隐藏` is deliberately absent, as requested.
- Menu dismissal works through outside click and Escape. Destructive editing/cover/delete actions remain manager-only; available reading actions remain available to members.
- Deleting the library record preserves the source file, matching the requested removal of the hide workflow without broadening deletion behavior.

## Verification

- Authenticated Chrome visual and DOM verification: passed.
- Global frame boundary comparison between parent and detail: passed.
- Focused ESLint: passed.
- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- i18n parity for `zh-CN` and `en-US`: passed with 2715 messages.
- Full Web test suite: passed, 239 tests.

## Compact action-menu follow-up

- Comparison reference: `codex-clipboard-e3736ebc-c671-4da6-9425-d2aa26759b41.png`.
- Previous oversized state: `codex-clipboard-7e9a06a3-147f-4d45-8eba-caa1cd18d159.png`.
- Implementation capture: `book-detail-compact-actions-menu.png`.
- At the same 2560 x 1296 viewport and 1.5 device-pixel ratio, the menu now measures 240 CSS px / 360 physical px wide, matching the approximately 360px reference width.
- Each action row measures 40 CSS px. With the requested seven actions and no library-hide action, the menu is 310.33 CSS px tall and keeps the reference density and separation.
- Labels, action order, outside-click dismissal, Escape dismissal, focus styling, and manager permissions remain unchanged.
- Focused ESLint, TypeScript typecheck, bilingual i18n validation (2715 messages), and all 239 Web tests passed.

final result: passed

## Setup language-switcher follow-up

- Source visual truth: `codex-clipboard-93acc614-7683-46c5-9f93-7ac92f3b60dc.png` (1980 x 1231 px, setup completion state, language menu open).
- Implementation capture: `artifacts/language-switcher-setup.png` (1980 x 1231 px, setup status-check state, language menu open); combined comparison: `artifacts/language-switcher-comparison.png`.
- The surrounding setup stage differs because browser verification used a local status-check fixture, but the focused language-control region uses the same viewport, placement, locale, and open interaction state.
- Fonts and copy: existing compact labels, icon, weights, and Chinese/English option text are unchanged; both locale transitions were exercised successfully.
- Spacing and layout: the 144px menu is right-aligned to the trigger, uses consistent 16px rounding and 8px internal padding, and remains clear of the right setup panel.
- Colors and tokens: trigger and menu both compute to `rgb(232, 220, 199)`; the menu border is `rgba(176, 139, 110, 0.45)`, while the selected option uses the setup orange at 15% opacity with dark orange text. The former white floating surface is removed.
- Assets: the existing Lucide language, chevron, and check icons remain sharp and consistent with the rest of the setup controls; no new raster assets were needed.
- Interaction and accessibility: listbox semantics, current-language check, right alignment, pointer selection, keyboard behavior, focus restoration, and Chinese/English switching remain intact.
- TypeScript typecheck, ESLint, i18n validation (2726 messages), and all 248 Web tests passed.

final result: passed

## Monitor-folder tree follow-up

- References: `codex-clipboard-8eb96d0a-0473-407d-865e-87ae81278436.png`, `codex-clipboard-bbd7276f-089e-4283-ac34-7b45ea564389.png`, and `codex-clipboard-b7d83d56-49b2-4626-937d-6b3bf13241b0.png`.
- Implementation capture: `artifacts/monitor-folder-tree-setup.png`; side-by-side comparison: `artifacts/monitor-folder-tree-comparison.png`.
- The editable combobox, directory panel, borders, focus color, surface color, and helper copy now use the initialization page's warm beige, olive, and orange visual system.
- The setup variant participates in normal document layout, so its expanded panel remains inside the rounded setup card instead of being clipped by the card boundary.
- The directory viewport measures 256px tall and remains scrollable. Its computed scrollbar color is `rgb(139, 157, 131)` on a transparent track; the selected node and panel remain inside the 1152px reference viewport.
- A restored or typed absolute path keeps `/` as the visible tree root, loads every ancestor in order, expands the selected directory, and exposes its children. The verified path `/home/liumianti/books` rendered `/ > home > liumianti > books`, with `books` selected and expanded.
- The input accepts typing and paste; the backend remains authoritative for absolute, existing, readable directory validation at save time.
- TypeScript typecheck, ESLint, bilingual i18n validation (2726 messages), and all 248 Web tests passed.

final result: passed

# Reader Mobile Quick Console Design QA

- Source visual truth: `/Users/guyu/.codex/generated_images/019fd04e-eece-7e72-a22d-a8ef64d7320b/exec-30234278-60a0-4960-94d7-5255d4824c8e.png`
- Browser-rendered implementation: `/Users/guyu/www/booknook/design-qa/reader-mobile-implementation-final.png`
- Full comparison: `/Users/guyu/www/booknook/design-qa/reader-mobile-full-comparison.png`
- Focused controls comparison: `/Users/guyu/www/booknook/design-qa/reader-mobile-controls-comparison.png`
- Viewport: 390 × 844 CSS px, device pixel ratio 1
- Source pixels: 853 × 1844, normalized by proportional scale and centered crop to 390 × 844
- Implementation pixels: 390 × 844
- State: warm-theme reflowable EPUB, reader controls open, no secondary dialog open

## Full-view comparison evidence

The normalized side-by-side comparison confirms the intended hierarchy: compact top pill, uninterrupted reading canvas, bottom progress row, four display shortcuts, and four navigation destinations. The final console starts at nearly the same vertical position as the source and retains a 12 px visual gap above the physical bottom edge.

## Focused region comparison evidence

The bottom 250 px comparison was used because the fidelity-critical controls are too small to judge reliably in the full view. Font adjustment, warm-theme swatch, pagination mode, More, directory, progress, notes, and selected Display state all preserve the source order, grouping, touch area, rounded geometry, and burnt-orange emphasis.

## Required fidelity surfaces

- Fonts and typography: UI labels use the product's existing system font stack with matching compact weights and sizes. Reading typography remains owned by the active reader preference instead of being hard-coded to the mock.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: console height, outer inset, progress spacing, four-column tracks, divider, bottom navigation, radii, and bottom safety gap match the target proportions.
- Colors and visual tokens: existing warm reader tokens are preserved; the warm swatch uses a slightly stronger paper tint so its state remains visible against the console surface.
- Image quality and assets: the target contains no raster imagery. Existing Lucide icons are used consistently with the application design system and remain sharp at device scale.
- Copy and content: labels match the design direction. Live chapter title and percentage intentionally reflect the current book rather than the mock's sample values.

## Comparison history

### Pass 1

- [P1] The font-size value was truncated inside the first quick-control cell.
  - Fix: changed the cell to explicit compact tracks and reduced the value typography to preserve `18` at 390 px.
- [P2] The console was about 24 px taller than the normalized target and left only 4 px below the surface.
  - Fix: reduced the mobile console from 17 rem to 15.5 rem and increased the visual bottom gap to 12 px plus the safe-area inset.
- [P2] The warm-theme swatch blended into the surrounding cream surface.
  - Fix: strengthened the warm swatch tint while retaining the existing theme color family.

### Final pass

- Post-fix evidence: `/Users/guyu/www/booknook/design-qa/reader-mobile-full-comparison.png` and `/Users/guyu/www/booknook/design-qa/reader-mobile-controls-comparison.png`.
- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 visual differences remain.
- P3: exact Lucide glyph shapes vary slightly from the generated concept, but remain consistent with the existing product icon system.

## Interaction and runtime verification

- Center tap opens the top and bottom controls.
- Font controls move through supported values (`18` to `22`) without leaving the preference range.
- More opens the full reading settings and removes the quick console from pointer and visual flow.
- Notes opens a combined Bookmarks/Annotations dialog; both tabs and the nested annotation categories are reachable.
- Directory, progress, close, selected states, and focus-trapped dialogs remain functional.
- Tablet control-panel switching remains functional.
- Browser console errors checked: none.
- Focused mobile quick-console E2E: passed.
- iOS safe-area E2E: passed.
- Tablet comic controller E2E: passed.

## Follow-up polish

- P3: a future pass could tune individual icon optical sizes by one pixel after testing on a physical iPhone and Android device.

final result: passed

# Reader unified control panel design QA

## Comparison target

- Source visual truth:
  - `C:/Users/gamer/AppData/Local/Temp/codex-clipboard-84010533-73f7-4b97-989d-a4b9a9eb143d.png` (collapsed desktop controller, 2187 × 1980 px).
  - `C:/Users/gamer/AppData/Local/Temp/codex-clipboard-dbfa84db-5635-4d24-8f62-6eca3e6e8081.png` (previous expanded directory state, 2320 × 2043 px).
  - The requested interaction brief is authoritative where it intentionally differs from the previous expanded-state screenshot: the collapsed controller must remain the same control instance and expand upward instead of being replaced by a second dock.
- Implementation evidence:
  - `/home/liumianti/booknook/design-qa-implementation-desktop.png` (1440 × 900 px; CSS viewport 1440 × 900; device scale factor 1).
  - `/home/liumianti/booknook/design-qa-implementation-mobile.png` (390 × 844 px; CSS viewport 390 × 844; device scale factor 1).
- State: EPUB directory open, warm theme, reader controller visible.
- Density normalization: source screenshots and implementation captures use different viewport sizes and fixture content, so the comparison is interaction- and component-focused rather than pixel-overlay based. Control proportions, anchoring, persistent identity, panel expansion, and responsive structure were compared at their native densities.

## Full-view comparison evidence

- Desktop: the expanded directory remains anchored to the same rounded bottom controller surface. The original desktop dock—including directory, notes, previous/next, progress slider, appearance, and settings—remains visible at the bottom while the directory content grows above it.
- Mobile: the mobile-specific quick console remains intact (progress, scale controls, theme, reading mode, more, and the four-item navigation dock), with the directory workspace expanding above it inside the same rounded surface.
- The panel stays inside viewport and safe-area bounds at both tested sizes.

## Focused region comparison evidence

- The bottom control region was inspected separately because persistent control identity is the core requirement. The implementation has one `[data-reader-console-controls="true"]` element before and after expansion, and its DOM identity is preserved while switching among directory, notes, appearance, and settings.
- The desktop expanded state intentionally differs from the old screenshot by retaining the complete progress/navigation dock rather than rendering the old second, reduced four-button dock.

## Required fidelity surfaces

- Fonts and typography: existing reader typography, hierarchy, weights, and truncation are preserved; no new font or copy treatment was introduced.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the workspace expands vertically above a fixed-height device-specific controller. Existing radii, borders, shadows, padding, safe-area spacing, and desktop maximum width are preserved.
- Colors and visual tokens: existing warm/dark reader theme surfaces and amber selected states are reused without new color literals for the panel structure.
- Image quality and assets: the control panel contains no raster content; existing Lucide icon assets remain sharp and consistent at both breakpoints.
- Copy and content: no new user-visible copy was added. Existing `zh-CN` and `en-US` catalog coverage remains complete.

## Findings

- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 visual or interaction mismatch remains for the requested unified-controller behavior.

## Open questions

- None. The mobile implementation is intentionally its own responsive control layout, not a scaled desktop dock.

## Comparison history

- Initial visual review found no blocking layout issue after the structural change. The requested mismatch—the second control definition in the expanded state—was removed before capture.
- Interaction regression then found two P2 issues adjacent to the unified surface: the focus trap included CSS-hidden controls from the other responsive layout, and the full-width console wrapper intercepted clicks outside the visible panel. The focusable filter now requires visible client geometry, and pointer events are owned by the visible surface so the dismiss layer remains reachable.
- Post-fix evidence and focused tests show one persistent control region at desktop and mobile sizes, correct keyboard focus wrapping within the visible device layout, working outside-click dismissal, and the content workspace expanding above the same controls.
- Transition follow-up: the controller is now absolutely anchored to the bottom of the persistent surface while the workspace occupies only the area above it. The controller has no enter animation, and the workspace can shrink to zero while the surface expands or collapses. Thirty animation-frame samples now verify that desktop and mobile controller top, bottom, height, and opacity remain fixed throughout both transitions, eliminating both the blank-controller frame and positional jitter.
- Mobile expanded-state follow-up source: `C:/Users/gamer/AppData/Local/Temp/codex-clipboard-3d8dea63-9463-40df-b44d-4f7ed61260b6.png` (848 x 1114 px). Implementation: `design-qa-implementation-mobile-toc.png` (390 x 844 px at a 390 x 844 CSS viewport and device scale factor 1). Combined evidence: `design-qa-comparison-mobile-toc.png`; the source was proportionally normalized to 623 x 844 px and the implementation remained at native size.
- The combined full-view and focused controller comparison confirms that the mobile progress and quick-setting region is removed in the expanded directory state, the directory workspace fills the released area, and the persistent four-item navigation stays fixed at the bottom. Typography, spacing rhythm, warm color tokens, Lucide icon quality, and existing localized copy remain consistent. No new raster assets or user-visible text were introduced.

## Implementation checklist

- [x] Keep one controller surface and one control definition per rendered breakpoint.
- [x] Expand directory, notes, appearance, and settings inside that surface.
- [x] Preserve the complete desktop progress/navigation dock while expanded.
- [x] Preserve the complete mobile quick console while expanded.
- [x] Verify safe-area bounds, panel switching, focus behavior, and persistent DOM identity.
- [x] Verify type checking, lint, i18n catalogs, and focused Chromium interaction tests.

## Follow-up polish

- No P3 follow-up is required for this change.

final result: passed
